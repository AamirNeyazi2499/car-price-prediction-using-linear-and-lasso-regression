# 🚗 Car Price Prediction using Linear and Lasso Regression

This project predicts the selling price of cars based on various features using **Linear Regression** and **Lasso Regression**. It compares both models to show how regularization affects performance and helps prevent overfitting.

## 📘 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to predict car prices using key attributes such as: 
- Year
- Present price
- Driven kilometers
- Fuel type
- Seller type
- Transmission type
- Owner count

The project demonstrates how both **Linear Regression** and **Lasso Regression** can be applied to real-world price prediction problems.
